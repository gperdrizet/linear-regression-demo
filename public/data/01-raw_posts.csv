Arizona State University concludes that CoT reasoning is superficial and not the product of genuine inductive inference. Instead, it is still heavily constrained by the training data distribution and only simulates reasoning-like text. To test this, the authors define three axies of generalization task, length and format. They then asses model performance on each, while systematically varying the degree of difference between training and test distributions. To see it - take a look a figure 4. CoT reasoning is no help in generalizing to new tasks, unless the model has has some amount of supervised fine-tuning on the same data. CMP, POOD and OOD represent test datasets with increasing distance from the training data. This could imply that CoT is not fundamentally different from other prompting strategies - but I would have liked to see different prompting strategies included as a control.

Stanford University and Databricks report a new autoregressive LLM trained on biomedical scientific literature from PubMed paired with a custom tokenizer. The model is open source and can handle multiple choice and short answer biomedical and clinical questions better than generalist models of similar size.
